  **************************Churn Analysis using Random Forest Algorithm***********************

Overview
Customer churn refers to the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company. In competitive industries, understanding the factors that lead to churn and predicting which customers are likely to leave is crucial. In this project, we use the Random Forest algorithm, a powerful ensemble machine learning method, to predict customer churn based on historical data.

This analysis aims to:

Understand key factors contributing to churn.
Develop a predictive model to identify customers likely to churn.
Provide actionable insights to reduce churn rates and improve customer retention.
Project Structure
Data: The dataset contains customer demographic information, service usage data, and churn labels (whether a customer churned or not).
Preprocessing: Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Modeling: We use the Random Forest algorithm to build a classification model. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and outputs the mode of the classes (classification).
Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, as well as confusion matrix and ROC-AUC curves.
Feature Importance: The Random Forest algorithm also provides insight into the importance of various features contributing to the prediction.
Dataset
Provide a brief description of the dataset here:
Features: List of important features such as customer tenure, monthly charges, contract type, payment method, etc.
Target Variable: The target variable is Churn (1 if the customer churned, 0 otherwise).
Source: If publicly available, mention the dataset source or reference.
Installation
To run this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

Preprocessing: Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data.
Training the Model: Train the Random Forest model using the preprocessed data.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model using the test dataset and analyze the results.

Conclusion
The Random Forest model effectively predicts customer churn with high accuracy and provides insights into the most critical factors driving customer attrition. Companies can leverage these insights to design targeted retention strategies, improving customer satisfaction and reducing churn.
